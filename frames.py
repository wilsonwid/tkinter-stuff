# all four types of widgets (Label, Button, Entry, Text) have the `master` attribute you can set

# window.mainloop()


# You can always do tk.Label(text = "some text").pack() and not have to worry about Python doing automatic garbage collection

# If you don't choose a `side` in .pack(), then it will automatically default to tk.TOP

# window = tk.Tk()

# frame1 = tk.Frame(master = window, width = 200, height = 100, bg = "red")
# frame1.pack(fill = tk.Y, side = tk.LEFT) # tk.Y makes vertical resizes resopnsive; tk.X makes horizontal resizes responsive

# frame2 = tk.Frame(master = window, width = 100, bg = "yellow")
# frame2.pack(fill = tk.Y, side = tk.LEFT)

# frame3 = tk.Frame(master = window, width = 100, bg = "blue")
# frame3.pack(fill = tk.Y, side = tk.LEFT)

# window.mainloop()

# to make resizes in both directions responsive, set the `fill` attribute to tk.BOTH and set `expand` to True

# =========================================================================================

# the .place() geometry manager allows you to place the widget in the exact location you want it to be
# however, since it's non-responsive and is difficult to manage layouts with, it isn't normally used
# people more often use the .grid() geometry manager since it's more intuitive


# window = tk.Tk()

# for i in range(3):
#     for j in range(3):
#         frame = tk.Frame(
#             master = window,
#             relief = tk.RAISED,
#             borderwidth = 1
#         )

#         frame.grid(row = i, column = j, padx = 3, pady = 3) # the padx and pady are between the frames
#         label = tk.Label(master = frame, text = f"Row: {i}, Column: {j}")
#         label.pack() # can also add padx and pady here

# window.mainloop()

# Even though .grid() is called on each Frame, the geometry manager actually acts upon the window object
# Even though .pack() is called on each Label, the geometry manager acts on the Frame

# =========================================================================================

# That being said, the geometry manager doesn't result in a responsive GUI
# To make it responsive, we use window.columnconfigure() and window.rowconfigure()

# window = tk.Tk()

# for i in range(3):
#     # weight determines how quickly the column/row grows relative to other columns/rows
#     window.columnconfigure(i, weight = 1, minsize = 75) 
#     window.rowconfigure(i, weight = 1, minsize = 50)

#     for j in range(3):
#         frame = tk.Frame(
#             master = window,
#             relief = tk.RAISED,
#             borderwidth = 1
#         )

#         frame.grid(row = i, column = j, padx = 5, pady = 5)

#         label = tk.Label(master = frame, text = f"Row: {i}, Column: {j}")
#         label.pack(padx = 5, pady = 5)
    
# window.mainloop()



# =========================================================================================

# One can use the `sticky` argument inside .grid() to determine where the element sticks inside the grid cell

window = tk.Tk()
window.columnconfigure(0, minsize = 250)
window.rowconfigure([0, 1], minsize = 100)

label1 = tk.Label(master = window, text = "A")
label1.grid(row = 0, column = 0, sticky = "n")

label2 = tk.Label(master = window, text = "B")
label2.grid(row = 1, column = 0, sticky = "s") 
# arguments to `sticky` can either be "n", "e", "s", "w" or their capitalised versions
# can also use combinations of them
# to fill an entire cell, use `sticky = "nsew"`
